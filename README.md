# Custom-telementry
Developed a custom Python-based telemetry and failsafe system for UAVs that captures real-time flight data, monitors parameters against safety thresholds, and triggers automated failsafe actions. Features modular design, data logging, and adaptability across platforms to enhance reliability and mission safety.
This Python script is a custom telemetry and failsafe monitoring system built using the pymavlink library, which allows communication with MAVLink-enabled UAVs. When the program starts, it establishes a connection to the flight controller through a specified port (in this case, COM3 at 57600 baud) and waits for a heartbeat signal to confirm that the UAV is online and transmitting data. Once connected, the script enters a loop where it continuously receives and processes MAVLink messages. These messages provide different types of flight data: GLOBAL_POSITION_INT gives latitude, longitude, and altitude, allowing the system to track the UAV’s position; SYS_STATUS reports the battery voltage and remaining percentage, which are crucial for monitoring power levels; ATTITUDE provides roll, pitch, and yaw values to show the UAV’s orientation; and HEARTBEAT indicates the current flight mode. The script uses predefined thresholds to check the health of the flight: if the altitude rises above 100 meters, or if the battery voltage drops below 10.5 volts, or if the battery percentage falls under 20%, it issues warnings to alert the operator of unsafe conditions. This makes the system act like a real-time safety net, continuously watching for anomalies that could lead to mission failure. The implementation is lightweight but effective, as it not only displays live telemetry data but also provides critical failsafe alerts without requiring heavy ground control software. Its modular design means the thresholds or monitored parameters can easily be customized to fit different UAVs and mission requirements. Overall, this project demonstrates how Python and MAVLink can be combined to create a simple, flexible, and reliable monitoring system that enhances the safety and reliability of UAV operations.
